Assumption 1: The following assumes you are on a Windows 10 or 11 machine.
Assumption 2: CAMELS data set version 1.2

To replicate my data processing steps, follow the instructions below:

1. Ensure your working directory has the data containing folders `daymet` and 
`usgs_streamflow` taken from the full CAMELS data set folder (you can download the
full CAMELS data set zip file from https://gdex.ucar.edu/dataset/camels.html).

`daymet` (input features) comes from:

\basin_timeseries_v1p2_metForcing_obsFlow\basin_dataset_public_v1p2\basin_mean_forcing\daymet

`usgs_streamflow` (target) comes from:

\basin_timeseries_v1p2_metForcing_obsFlow\basin_dataset_public_v1p2\usgs_streamflow

2. Remove the following files from `daymet`:

01\01150900_lump_cida_forcing_leap
03\02081113_lump_cida_forcing_leap
06\03448942_lump_cida_forcing_leap

We remove the above files because the corresponding usgs_streamflow files for these 3
gauge id's don't exists in `usgs_streamflow`. NOTE that I used the CAMELS data set version
1.2. In future versions of CAMELS, this problem may no longer be present.

3. Run process_raw_data.R

4. Run filter_processed_data.R
